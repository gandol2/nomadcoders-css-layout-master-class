          <span>“Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.</span>

            >I first saw Night of the Living Dead when I was around 9-years-old, but it wasn’t the full film. A comedy troupe called The L.A. Connection had a short-lived television show called Mad Movies (which predated Mystery Science Theater 3000 by a few years) where they would take beloved classic films, edit them
            down to 20 minutes, and re-dub all new dialogue, always turning the original story completely on its head. For example, they once did The Little Princess (1939) starring Shirley Temple, making Temple possessed by a doll, and only a song-and-dance exorcism can save her. For Night of the Living Dead, Barbara
            is throwing a surprise birthday party for herself and the zombies are party goers that arrive too early, throwing Barbara into a frenzy because she didn’t have anything cute to wear and she’s out of lettuce. Every time it cut to a shot of the zombies approaching the house or sticking their arms through
            windows you would hear them all saying, “surpriiiiisse…” in a mumbled, deadpan tone. It was magical.</span

            >“The nightmare world of a virgin’s dreams becomes the screen’s shocking reality!” I first saw this film when I was on a Catherine Deneuve kick (the first of many) in the 90s thanks to The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964). I also happened to be on a Roman Polanski kick after seeing Death and the Maiden (1994)
            in the theater. One plus one equals… I don’t know. I didn’t go to school for math. Repulsion is such an odd duck. I read that Polanski came up with this film in an effort to have a commercial success which would then help fund the film he really wanted to make, Cut-de-sac (1966). To think that Repulsion was
            designed to be a commercial success is astounding. This is like the bizarro version of a commercial success. It really has none of the ingredients of a crowd pleaser with the one exception maybe being Catherine Deneuve herself, but that would be something of a red herring. If she were the draw I expect
            viewers felt pretty bamboozled early in the film. I remember feeling kind of revolted when I finished the film. The whole thing is really pretty off-putting and unpleasant. But they do such an incredible job of putting you in the mind of Carol. The crumbling interior of the apartment; the rotting rabbit
            carcass; the silence and isolation. It’s all so powerful. It isn’t fun or entertaining, but if you’re looking to become immersed in a film that takes you to dark places, look no further.</span
